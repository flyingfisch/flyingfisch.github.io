I thought of writing a post going over the high-level abstract concepts of building a modern website, but decided to scratch that idea in favor of a step-by-step demo of the way I build websites. In this post I will be going from design to delivery on a nautical themed website for a sailing club. Let's get started!


# Design

The first step to building any website, of course, is coming up with a design. For this site I thought we would keep the layout fairly minimal. I don't generally build wireframes, preferring building in the browser instead, but I whipped one up in this case to let you see what kind of layout I am envisioning.

<img src="/assets/nautical-wireframe.svg" alt="Wireframe">
<figcaption>Wireframe</figcaption>
</figure>
